# Samba_3.x_4.x_Exploit (SMB 'username map script')
A python version of a Metasploit module that exploit "Samba 'username map script' Command Execution", 
I created this script to avoid using Metasploit, because it's not useful for studying. 👾

This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!
